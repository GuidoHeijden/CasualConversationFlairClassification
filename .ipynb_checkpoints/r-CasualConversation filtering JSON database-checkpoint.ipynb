    "Certain templated flairs exist as of March 2019 in r/CasualConversation. However, in previous months, those templated flairs were different or users used their own flairs. Therefore, the approach is to find all the submissions in the JSON database that are made in r/CasualConversations and filter these submissions based on the flairs that can be recognised a topic of discussion. For example, the submissions that have a flair containing the removal reason of the post or a random flair thought up by a user (e.g. üçï This subreddit is now sponsored by Domino's), will be filtered out."

      " My 16 year old daughter is a student studying media and she wants to be a make up artist when she advances from education. Today while I was at work, she sent me a picture of her self with what seemed to be a black eye and a few light bruises on her face. She didn't even write a message with the picture, it was just the picture by itself. So I called her, fearing the worst, and asked if she was alright. She then laughed and mocked me about how \"I fell for it\". I then responded \"I don't have for this, I'm at work\". Later on I texted her, jokingly, that she can make her own dinner tonight. Didn't know that she was learning how to do zombie make up for an assignment she is doing in class where they have to make a short film on zombies. So she decided to use the opportunity to play a prank on me and I fell for it like a fool. LOL. I guess best thing is she got a laugh out of it and she wasn't actually beaten up.\n",

      " So this is my second year playing fantasy football. If you don't know the premise, it's where a group of people have a league and \"draft\" real life sports players and they score points based on a point system. Anyway, my friend invited me to play in his league and I was ecstatic to do so. Last year, I played in a random league and won the championship. This year i was doing well and made the playoffs for the championship. Well I caught him switching players around, who had scored better points (you have a bench for extra players than your lineup) so basically he had the commissioner, who is a close childhood friend of his, put his better players in for him. Essentially giving him the edge for the win this week. There's 8 people in this league, and each player pays $25 to the winner, so the winner gets $175. To have found out that this has been going on for at the least the last 2 weeks, and witness it first hand is sickening. He was my close friend I served with. At first he denied it, but once I dug around and found all the proof, he started spewing out all these excuses and everything.

If I try to find something to critique about, maybe just the dialogue or voice acting, but even that is only a little cheesy at some points. The whole Driver/Blade mechanic gives me a Soul Eater vibe. The combat is fun and unique, there is a ton of exploring you can do with different Blades, I've only played it for two days but it's already looking to be in my top 5 RPGs, easily.\\n\\nHas anyone else tried it or maybe have a game they just tried that they're already in love with?\", 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'CasualConversation', 'subreddit_id': 't5_323oy', 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': 'I just want to gush about Xenoblade right now.', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/7j2a3w/i_just_want_to_gush_about_xenoblade_right_now/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'comment_influx': [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9], 'comment_toplevel_text': ['The only games i ever fell completely head over heels addicted to was MGS2 and Fable 2.', 'I‚Äôll probably buy it, but I don‚Äôt know if I would like it because I never played a JRPG before, and I‚Äôm pretty bad on most of the games.
