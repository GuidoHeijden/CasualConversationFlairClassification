    "Certain templated flairs exist as of March 2019 in r/CasualConversation. However, in previous months, those templated flairs were different or users used their own flairs. Therefore, the approach is to find all the submissions in the JSON database that are made in r/CasualConversations and filter these submissions based on the flairs that can be recognised a topic of discussion. For example, the submissions that have a flair containing the removal reason of the post or a random flair thought up by a user (e.g. üçï This subreddit is now sponsored by Domino's), will be filtered out."
